This is a pairing exercise for prospective front-end developers.

The aim is to create a responsive table similar to the screenshot in this repo (portfolio_ui.png)

The candidate can guide the exercise and do as much as is feasible within the time limit (~40-45 mins).

How to run:

- Create a new branch
- Run `yarn start` or `npm start`
- Go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the basic hello world app
- Work from the `./src` folder in this directory
- At the end of the test, commit candidate's code and push to GitHub
- You can run tests with Jest: `yarn test`

The master branch should be kept clean.
